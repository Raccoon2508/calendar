# Calendar test task from Raccoon2508

Please, remember: it's very first time when I work with Angular.


# Start App

You need next commands:

    npm install
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ng build
    ng serve
    

In other terminal window

    npm install -g json-server  
    json-server --watch db.json
Please, use port 3000.


Some realized opportunities:

 - Endless calendar
 - Adaptive markdown
 - Login (pseudo, without real autification)
 - Ability to add new user
 - Abilities to add and delete events
 - Different colors of events with diff. priorites
 - Data exchange through a local server
